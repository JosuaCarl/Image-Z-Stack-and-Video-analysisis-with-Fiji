# Image-Z-Stack-and-Video-analysisis-with-Fiji

A script that navigates through folders and subfolders of a starting point, miming the folder structure at a given output path, and opening all files with a defined suffix for further analysis. The analyis separates microscopy input into separate channels, merges and saves them with a naming scheme that can be adjusted in the code. The script detects automatically, whether the given file is a image, z-stack or video and will adjust analysis accordingly. Just try it out on your microscopy images and see the magic happen.

## Installation
Just download the .ijm file or clone the repository with a method to your liking.

## Application
I prefer opening Fiji and then navigating to `Plugins -> Macros -> Edit`. Then click on `File -> Open` and select the file. After that just click `Run` or select `Run -> Run` in the upper menu.
